          <h2 class="heading-2">HAS INDIA GOT CHEATED BY AUSIS.</h2>
          <p>If there was one turning point in the World Cup 2023 final that put paid to India's chances, it was Rohit Sharma's dismissal. Before his wicket, India were cruising,
             scoring at almost nine runs an over and had blazed away, as usual, to 76/2 in 9.4 overs. 
             But the moment Rohit was out to that brilliant piece of catching from Travis Head, 
             it was as if the wheels just fell off. From smashing eight fours and three sixes in the first 10
              overs, to just four across the next 40, India simply never recovered, and eventually paid the price.
